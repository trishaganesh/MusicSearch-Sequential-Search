# MusicSearch-Sequential-Search
This program creates several sequential search methods and performs the searches using a collection of music.

The purpose of this program is to understand how Sequential Search works in order to search for various elements within an array to find them. 
For this project, we were asked to create a music playlist with 10 music objects and we needed to use search methods to find 
values for the title of the song, year released, and the song artist.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how we could use the search methods and how they were different from methods used in the past. 
Turns out, the methods aren't too different. Most methods learned so far allowed us to practice more and increase our usage of Arrays. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed understanding how sequential search works and how it can be used in this program. 
I enjoyed finding various values within an array and displaying them for the output.
